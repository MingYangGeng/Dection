1.Abstract
Apple flower detection and positioning is significant for mechanical and chemical thinning of flowers. Only one or two of the strongest flowers from one cluster are retained for thinning. The DPC algorithm was improved to achieve the discrimination of apple flower clusters and the detection of central and peripheral flowers were not well solved. The proposed algorithm was based on the YOLOv8n model to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model to identify the central flowers in clusters. The model was trained and optimized to ensure efficient apple flower detection in natural scenarios. Furthermore, the Single-Layer DPC algorithm was improved for apple flower cluster discrimination, and the Double-Layer DPC algorithm was improved for apple central and peripheral flower detection. The performance of Single-Layer DPC algorithm was compared with Density Peaks Clustering (DPC), DPC with Shared Nearest Neighbors (DPC-SNN), K-means, K-medoids, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Spectral Clustering (SC) and Mini Batch K-means (minibatch) on three synthetic datasets. The Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of the proposed method were 0.7037 and 0.6043 on the Flame dataset, which were significantly higher than the highest values of the other eight clustering methods (0.5583 and 0.5116), respectively. The improved algorithm corrected the deviation between the clustering centres generated by the Single-Layer DPC algorithm and the true centres. The results showed that the proposed method could accurately discriminate apple flowers between different branches and clusters and detect of apple central and peripheral flowers.

2.What we do?
An automatic DPC algorithm based on YOLOv8 to detect apple flowers was presented in this article. Additionally, a precise discrimination model was devised to ascertain the specific flower cluster and central flower to which each individual flower belongs. This approach aimed to provide a reference for the detection of apple central and peripheral flowers, thereby promoting technical support for intelligent flower thinning.
3.Why we do?
（1）Farming aspect
① Cows in large-scale dairy farms are conceived through artificial insemination, however, the estrus period of cows is very short, about more than 20 days of estrus once, each time only lasts 4-26 hours, during which mounting behavior is the most significant external manifestation.
② Traditional manual inspections are labor-intensive, highly subjective, and low accuracy, and can no longer meet the requirements of modern farming.
（2）Technical aspect
③ Computer vision-based methods can minimize the stress caused by contact devices on cows.
④ Existing computer vision-based methods can only detect the mounting behavior of cows, but cannot locate individual estrus cows and lack an early warning mechanism.

4. What we accomplished?
(1) An estrus cow detection and tracking algorithm YOLO-TransT was proposed by integrating the improved YOLOv8n and TransT models.
(2) By introducing Context Augmentation Module (CAM) and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules into the YOLOv8n model, integrating scene-related information of estrus cow and mounting behavior, discarding redundant features, to achieve high detection accuracy.
(3) A dairy cow estrus monitoring and warning system was designed based on the YOLO-TransT model, which could effectively meet the dairy cow estrus monitoring needs of large-scale farms and improve the level of refined management.
